0001.0    10 February 2012 - Friday

0001.1    Working on the positional relationships between the various parts of
          the two right panels (XZ and YZ).  They really should look identical
          to the left (XY) panel.

          From the Object Inspector

          The PRIMARY XY drawing controls:

          Panel3   { The underlying panel for XY - needed to handle Splitter1  }
            Panel5 { The bottom caption panel "X" }
            Panel6 { The right caption panel "Y" }
            Panel7 { The intermediate panel for XY - see contents below }
              ScrollBarXY_X { bottom of Panel 7 }
              ScrollBarXY_Y { right of Panel 7 }
              Panel12 { Contains the X and Y rulers ( X first }
                XYRuler_XPB { X ruler's paint box }
                XYRuler_YPB { Y ruler's paint box }
                XYDrawingPB { The drawing paint box }

          The lower right ZY drawing controls (as of 10:20 AM)

          Panel2    { The underlying panel fo YZ - needed to handle Splitter2 }
            Panel9  { The bottom caption panel "Y" }
            Panel11 { The right caption panel "Z" }  <== Need intermediate panel
            YZRuler_YPB { Y ruler's paint box }      <== Should be child of paint-box panel
            YZRuler_ZPB { Z ruler's paint box }
            ScrollBarYZ_Z
            ScrollBarYZ_Y

          The lower right YZ drawing controls as they should be.

          Panel2    { The underlying panel fo YZ - needed to handle Splitter2 }
            Panel9  { The bottom caption panel "Y" }
            Panel11 { The right caption panel "Z" }
              Panel13
                ScrollBarYZ_Y
                ScrollBarYZ_Y
                  Panel12
                    YZRuler_YPB { Y ruler's paint box }
                    YZRuler_ZPB { Z ruler's paint box }
                    YZDrawing

0002.0  25 February 2012 - Sunday

0002.1  Did total redesign of the drawing controls - Created a single frame
        containing the drawing box and two rulers - eliminated the scroll bars
        because they had insufficient resolution even at the pixel level.

        Changed the scrolling capability to use the rulers.  Just click on ruler
        and drag in the direction you want to move and the ruler (and drawing)
        follows the cursor.  Much better design.  Also eliminates the need to
        know the exact extents (minX, maxX, etc.) of the drawing.

        Once I got the single frame working, I created a DrawingSetFrame that
        has three DrawingFrames separated by splitters for XY, XZ and YZ axes.
        Handled the resize event to keep the relative sizes of the DrawingFrames
        constant.

0002.2  Started working on the implementation of Layers.  Original concept was to
        allow the user to generate his own layer labels and re-order them according
        to the order in which he wanted to render them.

        Decided to start off with a pre-defined set of layers with a fixed order
        of rendering as in (in this list, the top layers are rendered first, the
        lowest layers are rendered last.  This way the track layers have higher
        priority than anything else.  Need to worry about rendering tunnels):

           Building/Room
           Framework
           Scenery (elevation and vegetation).
           Structures
           Track 3
           Track 2
           Track 1

        Layers themselves will be Objects with differing drawing abilities.
        As in:

           TLayer = class(TPersistentz)
           TBuildingLayer = class(TLayer) ...
           *
           *
           *
           TTrack = class(TLayer).

        Track rendering will be best effort based on Track Gauge, Scale (e.g. HO,
        N, Z) and Drawing Zoom.  At highest zoom ratios they will be rendered as
        single pixel lines.

        Available thrack gauges will be:

          5'0".    (Eastern European, Russia, etc.)
          4'8.5"   (Standard Gauge)
          3 m.     (Xnm)
          3'0"     (Xn3)
          2'6"     (Xn2.5)
          2'0"     (Xn2 Maine 2 footers).

          Make provisions for eventual dual gauge track rendering.

0002.3  Design of the Layer editing GUI.
