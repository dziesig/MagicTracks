MagicTracks is a CAD-like program for use by Model Railroaders.

The top-level data object is a Drawing, many of which may be opened simultaneously.

Each Drawing consists of several layers, many of which may be viewed
simultaneously, one of which may be edited at any given time.

Each Layer consists of several drawing objects.

A drawing object may be a drawing primitive, or a group of drawing objects.

Drawing primitives are 3-dimensional objects.  As of April 11, 2012 the
following Drawing Primitives are being developed:

          Rectangular Solid (generalization of a cube)
          Ellipsoid (generalization of a sphere)
          Straight Line (from x0, y0, z0 to x1, y1, z1)
          Bezier Curves (in 3 dimensions).
